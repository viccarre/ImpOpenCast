ImpOpenCast
===========

ImpCast is a small Open Source device which shows the forecast of an specific city. This project uses the API of openweathermap.org, to change the city just change the URL in the Agent code. ImpCast uses the USB + Serial Backpack Kit from Adafruit. This display is not suitable for connecting directly to the imp without some form of level adjustment, so instead of using the Electric Imp developer edition we are using an Electric Imp module development board which is available in MakeDeck (this board has a 5V output).
